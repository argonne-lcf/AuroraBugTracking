  - name: 'Warning: Automated Issue Parsing'
    about: |
      Highly recommended to use the Bug Report Form template.
      Please do not modify any of the \#\#\# headings in the resulting Issue body.
      Issues filed with the blank template are discouraged, since they are unlikely
      to be compatible with the GitHub Action parser that produces the Markdown summary
      table. Use "do-not-parse" Label on incorrectly-formatted Issues.
